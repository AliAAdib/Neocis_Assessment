# Neocis_Assessment
Use the following link to be able to independently run the Jupyter Notebooks associated with the Software 1 and 2 challenge. Please note that Binder initialization will take about 5 minutes so that the needed dependencies and libraries are downloaded and available to be used by the notebooks. 

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AliAAdib/Neocis_Assessment/main?force-rebuild=true)

If you do not want to run the notebooks vai this method I have also attached them to my submission email and you can run it on your computer if you have Python and Jupyter Notebooks installed. Alternatively if you prefer not to test the codes you can find the results created by my codes in the results.rar file in this GitHub repo. You can download and view them. There is an analysis_results.csv file for challenge one and a results folder for challenge two.
